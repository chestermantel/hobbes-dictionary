Laity,"giving to other Christians the name of Laity, that is, simply People.",Chapter XLIV: Of Spirituall Darknesse from Misinterpretation of Scripture,336,,defined by contrast with Clergy; marginal label: And that the Pastors are the Clergy. Hobbes exposes the ideological stakes of the clergy/laity distinction
Canon Law,"the Canon Law being the Acts of the Pope in the same Dominions. Which Canons, though they were but Canons, that is, Rules Propounded, and but voluntarily received by Christian Princes, till the translation of the Empire to Charlemain; yet afterwards, as the power of the Pope encreased, became Rules Commanded.",Chapter XLIV: Of Spirituall Darknesse from Misinterpretation of Scripture,336,,"contrasted with Civil Law; Hobbes shows how voluntary rules became coercive papal commands, illustrating usurpation of civil sovereignty"
Consecration,"To Consecrate, is in Scripture, to Offer, Give, or Dedicate, in pious and decent language and gesture, a man, or any other thing to God, by separating of it from common use; that is to say, to Sanctifie, or make it Gods, and to be used only by those, whom God hath appointed to be his Publike Ministers; and thereby to change, not the thing Consecrated, but onely the use of it, from being Profane and common, to be Holy, and peculiar to Gods service.",Chapter XLIV: Of Spirituall Darknesse from Misinterpretation of Scripture,337,Holy; Holy; Profane,"marginal label: Error from mistaking Consecration or Conjuration. Hobbes's scriptural definition of Consecration, sharply distinguished from Conjuration"
Conjuration,"But when by such words, the nature or qualitie of the thing it selfe, is pretended to be changed, it is not Consecration, but either an extraordinary worke of God, or a vaine and impious Conjuration.",Chapter XLIV: Of Spirituall Darknesse from Misinterpretation of Scripture,337,Consecration; Nature,"defined by contrast with Consecration; Hobbes attacks transubstantiation as conjuration, i.e. deceitful magic rather than legitimate sacrament"
Sacrament of the Lord's Supper,"Consecrating Bread and Wine to Gods peculiar service in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, (which is but a separation of it from the common use, to signifie, that is, to put men in mind of their Redemption, by the Passion of Christ, whose body was broken, and blood shed upon the Crosse for our transgressions.)",Chapter XLIV: Of Spirituall Darknesse from Misinterpretation of Scripture,338,Body; Redemption; Sacrament,"Hobbes redefines the Eucharist as memorial-signification only, rejecting transubstantiation and Roman sacramental theology"

Hobbes debunks the immortal immaterial soul; soul = life, not a separable substance"
Eternal Torments,"The Fire, or Torments prepared for the wicked in Gehenna, Tophet, or in what place soever, may continue for ever; and there may never want wicked men to be tormented in them; though not every, nor any one Eternally.",Chapter XLIV: Of Spirituall Darknesse from Misinterpretation of Scripture,346,Gehenna,marginal label: Eternall Torments what. Hobbes reinterprets eternal fire as ongoing but not personally unending torment; debunks Catholic doctrine of individual eternal punishment
Second Death,"To the Reprobate there remaineth after the Resurrection, a Second, and Eternall Death: between which Resurrection, and their Second, and Eternall death, is but a time of Punishment and Torment; and to last by succession of sinners thereunto, as long as the kind of Man by propagation shall endure; which is Eternally.",Chapter XLIV: Of Spirituall Darknesse from Misinterpretation of Scripture,346,Punishment,"Hobbes redefines 'Second Death' as a real final death, not eternal life in torment — rejecting the scholastic gloss that 'everlasting death' means 'everlasting torment'"
Purgatory,"Upon this Doctrine of the Naturall Eternity of separated Soules, is founded (as I said) the Doctrine of Purgatory. For supposing Eternall Life by Grace onely, there is no Life, but the Life of the Body; and no Immortality till the Resurrection.",Chapter XLIV: Of Spirituall Darknesse from Misinterpretation of Scripture,347,Body; Life,marginal label: Answer of the Texts alledged for Purgatory. Hobbes attacks purgatory as logically dependent on the false doctrine of naturally immortal separated souls
Kingdom of Grace,"Christian men are already in the Kingdome of Grace, in as much as they have already the Promise of being received at his comming againe.",Chapter XLIV: Of Spirituall Darknesse from Misinterpretation of Scripture,335,Promise,"distinguished from the Kingdom of God (which is yet to come at Christ's second coming); the Kingdom of Grace is a promissory state only, not a present political realm"
Eternal Life,"God created Adam in an estate of Living for Ever, which was conditionall, that is to say, if he disobeyed not his Commandement; which was not essentiall to Humane Nature, but consequent to the vertue of the Tree of Life... and that Christs Passion is a Discharge of sin to all that beleeve on him; and by consequence, a restitution of Eternall Life, to all the Faithfull, and to them onely.",Chapter XLIV: Of Spirituall Darknesse from Misinterpretation of Scripture,339,Life; Nature; Sin,"marginal label: Errors from mistaking Eternall Life, and Everlasting Death. Hobbes insists eternal life is a grace given to the faithful, not a natural property of all human souls"
Immortality of the Soul,"the Doctrine is now, and hath been a long time far otherwise; namely, that every man hath Eternity of Life by Nature, in as much as his Soul is Immortall: So that the flaming Sword at the entrance of Paradise, though it hinder a man from coming to the Tree of Life, hinders him not from the Immortality which God took from him for his Sin.",Chapter XLIV: Of Spirituall Darknesse from Misinterpretation of Scripture,339,Life; Nature; Sin; Soul,"marginal label: The immortality of mans Soule, not proved by Scripture to be of Nature, but of Grace. Hobbes presents the mainstream doctrine (soul naturally immortal) only to refute it as false and scripture-less"
Indulgences,"Indulgences; that is to say, of exemption for a time, or for ever, from the fire of Purgatory, wherein these Incorporeall Substances are pretended by burning to be cleansed, and made fit for Heaven.",Chapter XLIV: Of Spirituall Darknesse from Misinterpretation of Scripture,341,Purgatory,"marginal label: As the Doctrine of Purgatory, and Exorcismes, and Invocation of Saints. Hobbes defines Indulgences and ties them to the false doctrine of purgatory and separated souls"
Heresies,"Where, by Heresies are understood all opinions which the Church of Rome hath forbidden to be maintained.",Chapter XLIV: Of Spirituall Darknesse from Misinterpretation of Scripture,336,,"Hobbes exposes 'Heresy' as a politically operative term defined by papal authority, not by Scripture — used to discipline civil subjects"
Incantation,"it is no other than a Conjuration or Incantation, whereby they would have men to beleeve an alteration of Nature that is not, contrary to the testimony of mans Sight, and of all the rest of his Senses.",Chapter XLIV: Of Spirituall Darknesse from Misinterpretation of Scripture,338,Conjuration; Nature; Sight,marginal label: Incantation in the Ceremonies of Baptisme. Hobbes equates Roman Catholic liturgical formulae for Baptism with pagan incantation and fraud
Sight,"The impression made on the organs of Sight, by lucide Bodies, either in one direct line, or in many lines, reflected from Opaque, or refracted in the passage through Diaphanous Bodies, produceth in living Creatures, in whom God hath placed such Organs, an Imagination of the Object, from whence the Impression proceedeth; which Imagination is called Sight.",Chapter XLV: Of Demonology and Other Reliques of the Religion of the Gentiles,352,Imagination; Imagination; Object,"marginal label: The Originall of Demonology. Hobbes grounds sight in mechanistic optics to show that spectral apparitions are merely imaginative, not supernatural entities"
Imagination,"the motion made by this pressure, continuing after the object which caused it is removed, is that we call Imagination, and Memory, and (in sleep, and sometimes in great distemper of the organs by Sicknesse, or Violence) a Dream.",Chapter XLV: Of Demonology and Other Reliques of the Religion of the Gentiles,352,Memory; Object,marginal label: The Originall of Demonology. Hobbes reiterates his mechanistic definition of Imagination to undercut belief in demons as real entities
Demons,"But Both of them agree on one generall appellation of them, DEMONS. As if the Dead of whom they Dreamed, were not Inhabitants of their own Brain, but of the Air, or of Heaven, or Hell; not Phantasmes, but Ghosts.",Chapter XLV: Of Demonology and Other Reliques of the Religion of the Gentiles,353,Ghosts; Phantasmes,marginal label: The Originall of Demonology. Hobbes identifies 'Demons' as brain-phantasms mistaken for real beings; ALL CAPS signals this is the term being defined
Daemonology,"that DAEMONOLOGY (in which the Poets, as Principall Priests of the Heathen Religion, were specially employed, or reverenced) to the Publique Peace, and to the Obedience of Subjects necessary thereunto; and to make some of them Good Daemons, and others Evill; the one as a Spurre to the Observance, the other, as Reines to withhold them from Violation of the Laws.",Chapter XLV: Of Demonology and Other Reliques of the Religion of the Gentiles,353,Good; Peace; Religion; Religion,ALL CAPS term defined in context; Hobbes exposes demonology as a political instrument of the heathen commonwealth used to induce obedience
Daemoniaques,"they called Daemoniaques, that is, possessed by the Devill, such as we call Madmen or Lunatiques; or such as had the Falling Sicknesse; or that spoke any thing, which they for want of understanding, thought absurd.",Chapter XLV: Of Demonology and Other Reliques of the Religion of the Gentiles,353,Understanding; Understanding,"Hobbes naturalistically reinterprets demoniacs as the mentally ill, depriving the Church of its basis for exorcism"
Incorporeal Spirits,"I find in Scripture that there be Angels, and Spirits, good and evill; but not that they are Incorporeall, as are the Apparitions men see in the Dark, or in a Dream, or Vision; which the Latines call Spectra, and took for Daemons. And I find that there are Spirits Corporeall, (though subtile and Invisible;) but not that any mans body was possessed, or inhabited by them.",Chapter XLV: Of Demonology and Other Reliques of the Religion of the Gentiles,356,Body; Good; Vision,marginal label: The Scriptures doe Not teach spirits are Incorporeall. Hobbes debunks incorporeal spirits as a scholastic/pagan error not warranted by Scripture
Exorcism,"the use of Exorcisme, (that is to say, of ejection of Devills by Conjuration) is thereupon built.",Chapter XLV: Of Demonology and Other Reliques of the Religion of the Gentiles,356,Conjuration,"marginal label: The Power of Casting out Devills, not the same it was in the Primitive Church. Hobbes defines exorcism and links it directly to the false doctrine of incorporeal spirits"
Worship,"to Pray to, to Swear by, to Obey, to bee Diligent, and Officious in Serving: in summe, all words and actions that betoken Fear to Offend, or Desire to Please, is Worship, whether those words and actions be sincere, or feigned: and because they appear as signes of Honoring, are ordinarily also called Honor.",Chapter XLV: Of Demonology and Other Reliques of the Religion of the Gentiles,357,Desire; Fear,marginal label: What is Worship. Hobbes provides his comprehensive behavioral definition of worship; CULTUS in Latin; applies regardless of sincerity
Civil Worship,"The Worship we exhibite to those we esteem to be but men, as to Kings, and men in Authority, is Civill Worship.",Chapter XLV: Of Demonology and Other Reliques of the Religion of the Gentiles,358,Authority; Worship,marginal label: Distinction between Divine and Civill Worship. Defined by contrast with Divine Worship; worship directed at men qua men
Divine Worship,"But the worship we exhibite to that which we think to bee God, whatsoever the words, ceremonies, gestures, or other actions be, is Divine Worship.",Chapter XLV: Of Demonology and Other Reliques of the Religion of the Gentiles,358,Worship,"marginal label: Distinction between Divine and Civill Worship. Defined by the intention of the worshipper, not by external form or the words Douleia/Latreia"
Image,"An IMAGE (in the most strict signification of the word) is the Resemblance of some thing visible: In which sense the Phantasticall Formes, Apparitions, or Seemings of visible Bodies to the Sight, are onely Images; such as are the Shew of a man, or other thing in the Water, by Reflexion, or Refraction; or of the Sun, or Stars by Direct Vision in the Air; which are nothing reall in the things seen, nor in the place where they seem to bee.",Chapter XLV: Of Demonology and Other Reliques of the Religion of the Gentiles,358,Sense; Sense; Sight; Vision,marginal label: An Image what. Hobbes defines 'Image' strictly as optical appearance to undermine the metaphysical status of religious images
Ideas,"these are the Images which are originally and most properly called IDEAS, and IDOLS, and derived from the language of the Grecians, with whom the word EI'&o signifieth to See.",Chapter XLV: Of Demonology and Other Reliques of the Religion of the Gentiles,358,Idols,"ALL CAPS; Hobbes etymologizes Ideas/Idols as Greek for 'to see' — mental appearances, not Platonic forms; important deflation of scholastic terminology"
Idols,"these are the Images which are originally and most properly called IDEAS, and IDOLS, and derived from the language of the Grecians, with whom the word EI'&o signifieth to See. They are also called PHANTASMES, which is in the same language, Apparitions.",Chapter XLV: Of Demonology and Other Reliques of the Religion of the Gentiles,358,Ideas; Phantasmes,"ALL CAPS; Hobbes identifies Idols, Ideas, and Phantasmes as three names for the same mental phenomena — optical impressions with no external metaphysical reality"
Phantasmes,"They are also called PHANTASMES, which is in the same language, Apparitions.",Chapter XLV: Of Demonology and Other Reliques of the Religion of the Gentiles,358,,ALL CAPS; equated with Images and Idols as mental appearances; Hobbes uses this to collapse the category of supernatural apparitions
Material Images,"a man can fancy Shapes he never saw; making up a Figure out of the parts of divers creatures... So can he also give Matter to those Shapes, and make them in Wood, Clay or Metall. And these are also called Images, not for the resemblance of any corporeall thing, but for the resemblance of some Phantasticall Inhabitants of the Brain of the Maker.",Chapter XLV: Of Demonology and Other Reliques of the Religion of the Gentiles,359,Fancy; Fancy,marginal label: Materiall Images. Hobbes distinguishes material images (manufactured) from strict optical images; both ultimately derived from brain-phantasms
Idolatry,"IDOLATRY is, which is forbidden in the Second Commandement... To worship an Image, is voluntarily to doe those externall acts, which are signes of honoring either the matter of the Image, which is Wood, Stone, Metall, or some other visible creature; or the Phantasme of the brain, for the resemblance, or representation whereof, the matter was formed and figured; or both together, as one animate Body, composed of the Matter and the Phantasme, as of a Body and Soule. And the worship of these with Divine Honour, is that which is in the Scripture called Idolatry, and Rebellion against God.",Chapter XLV: Of Demonology and Other Reliques of the Religion of the Gentiles,360,Body; Honour; Image; Rebellion; Worship,"marginal label: Idolatry what. Hobbes provides his full definition of Idolatry, explicitly distinguishing it from civil or authorized religious use of images"
Holy,"to acknowledge it Holy, that is to say, to acknowledge the Image, or the Place to be set apart from common use: for that is the meaning of the word Holy; which implies no new quality in the Place, or Image; but onely a new Relation by Appropriation to God.",Chapter XLV: Of Demonology and Other Reliques of the Religion of the Gentiles,360,Image,"Hobbes debunks 'holiness' as an inherent quality — it is merely relational (set apart for God's use), not an ontological transformation; a key anti-Catholic move"
Scandalous Worship,"Besides the Idolatrous Worship of Images, there is also a Scandalous Worship of them; which is also a sin; but not Idolatry. For Idolatry is to worship by signes of an internall, and reall honour: but Scandalous Worship, is but Seeming Worship; and may sometimes bee joined with an inward, and hearty detestation, both of the Image, and of the Phantasticall Dcemon.",Chapter XLV: Of Demonology and Other Reliques of the Religion of the Gentiles,362,Honour; Idolatry; Image; Scandalous; Sin; Worship,marginal label: Scandalous worship of Images. Hobbes distinguishes two species of Image-worship: Idolatry (genuine internal honor) and Scandalous Worship (outward compliance without inner honor)
Canonization,"by such testimony is CANONIZATION, now defined; and is the same with the 'Aoo-xri of the Heathen.",Chapter XLV: Of Demonology and Other Reliques of the Religion of the Gentiles,365,,"marginal label: Canonizing of Saints. Hobbes defines Canonization as equivalent to pagan deification of heroes — a relic of gentile religion, not a Christian institution"
Pontifex Maximus,"PONTIFEX MAXIMUS. This was the name of him that in the ancient Common-wealth of Rome, had the Supreme Authority under the Senate and People, of regulating all Ceremonies, and Doctrines concerning their Religion.",Chapter XLV: Of Demonology and Other Reliques of the Religion of the Gentiles,365,Authority; Religion; Religion,marginal label: The name of Pontifex. Hobbes historicizes the papal title as a Roman civil office taken over by the Bishops of Rome — a relic of gentile political religion
Procession,"that which they called Pompa, is the same that now is named Procession.",Chapter XLV: Of Demonology and Other Reliques of the Religion of the Gentiles,366,,"marginal label: Procession of Images. Hobbes identifies Christian religious processions as continuations of pagan idol-processions (Pompa, Thensa, Ferculum)"
Divine Inspiration,"there be, that pretend Divine Inspiration, to be a supernaturall entring of the Holy Ghost into a man, and not an acquisition of Gods graces, by doctrine, and study.",Chapter XLV: Of Demonology and Other Reliques of the Religion of the Gentiles,361,Holy; Holy; Inspiration,"Hobbes presents this definition only to contest it; he argues the safer view is that inspiration signifies God's assistance through study, not supernatural physical infusion"
Philosophy,"By PHILOSOPHY, is understood the Knowledge acquired by Reasoning, from the Manner of the Generation of any thing, to the Properties; or from the Properties, to some possible Way of Generation of the same; to the end to bee able to produce, as far as matter, and humane force permit, such Effects, as humane life requireth.",Chapter XLVI: Of Darkness from Vain Philosophy and Fabulous Traditions,367,Life,"marginal label: What Philosophy is. ALL CAPS term; Hobbes's formal definition of Philosophy as causal-productive reasoning, explicitly excluding Prudence, Revelation, and learning from authority"
Prudence,"we are not to account as any part thereof, that originall knowledge called Experience, in which consisteth Prudence: Because it is not attained by Reasoning, but found as well in Brute Beasts, as in Man; and is but a Memory of successions of events in times past.",Chapter XLVI: Of Darkness from Vain Philosophy and Fabulous Traditions,368,Experience; Memory,"marginal label: Prudence no part of Philosophy. Defined by exclusion from Philosophy; Prudence is experience-based memory, not scientific reasoning"
Faith,"that which is gotten by Reasoning from the Authority of Books; because it is not by Reasoning from the Cause to the Effect, nor from the Effect to the Cause; and is not Knowledg, but Faith.",Chapter XLVI: Of Darkness from Vain Philosophy and Fabulous Traditions,368,Authority,"marginal label: Nor learning taken upon credit of Authors. Defined by contrast with Philosophy and Knowledge; Faith = assent based on authority, not demonstrative reasoning"
Schola,"the place where any of them taught, and disputed, was called Schola, which in their Tongue signifieth Leasure; and their Disputations, Diatribce, that is to say, Passing of the time.",Chapter XLVI: Of Darkness from Vain Philosophy and Fabulous Traditions,369,,"Hobbes etymologizes 'School' as Greek for 'Leisure' — satirizing scholastic learning as idle time-passing, not genuine science"
University,"That which is now called an University, is a Joyning together, and an Incorporation under one Government of many Publique Schools, in one and the same Town or City.",Chapter XLVI: Of Darkness from Vain Philosophy and Fabulous Traditions,370,,marginal label: University what it is. Hobbes defines the University and immediately characterizes it as a tool of Roman Religion and Aristotelian scholasticism
Aristotelity,"since the Authority of Aristotle is onely current there, that study is not properly Philosophy, (the nature whereof dependeth not on Authors,) but Aristotelity.",Chapter XLVI: Of Darkness from Vain Philosophy and Fabulous Traditions,370,Authority; Nature; Philosophy,Hobbes coins 'Aristotelity' as a satirical name for university study that masquerades as Philosophy but is really deference to Aristotle's authority
Philosophia Prima,"There is a certain Philosophia prima, on which all other Philosophy ought to depend; and consisteth principally, in right limiting of the significations of such Appellations, or Names, as are of all others the most Universall: Which Limitations serve to avoid ambiguity, and aequivocation in Reasoning; and are commonly called Definitions; such as are the Definitions of Body, Time, Place, Matter, Forme, Essence, Subject, Substance, Accident, Power, Act, Finite, Infinite, Quantity, Quality, Motion, Action, Passion.",Chapter XLVI: Of Darkness from Vain Philosophy and Fabulous Traditions,371,Body; Definitions; Essence; Philosophy; Quantity; Subject; Substance,Hobbes defines the foundational discipline of first philosophy (what he calls Philosophia Prima) as definition of universal terms; sets up his critique of Aristotelian Metaphysics
Metaphysics,"The Explication (that is, the setling of the meaning) of which, and the like Terms, is commonly in the Schools called Metaphysiques; as being a part of the Philosophy of Aristotle, which hath that for title: but it is in another sense; for there it signifieth as much, as Books written, or placed after his naturall Philosophy: But the Schools take them for Books of supernaturall Philosophy.",Chapter XLVI: Of Darkness from Vain Philosophy and Fabulous Traditions,371,Philosophy; Sense; Sense,"Hobbes exposes the ambiguity of 'Metaphysics': originally just 'what comes after the Physics' in Aristotle's arrangement, but misread by scholastics as supernatural philosophy"
Abstract Essences,"there be in the world certain Essences separated from Bodies, which they call Abstract Essences, and Substantiall Formes.",Chapter XLVI: Of Darkness from Vain Philosophy and Fabulous Traditions,371,,marginal label: Errors concerning Abstract Essences. Hobbes presents the scholastic claim in order to debunk it; 'Abstract Essences' are the central target of his anti-Aristotelian attack
The World (Universe),"The World, (I mean not the Earth onely, that denominates the Lovers of it Worldly men, but the Universe, that is, the whole masse of all things that are) is Corporeall, that is to say, Body; and hath the dimensions of Magnitude, namely, Length, Bredth, and Depth: also every part of Body, is likewise Body, and hath the like dimensions; and consequently every part of the Universe, is Body; and that which is not Body, is no part of the Universe: And because the Universe is All, that which is no part of it, is Nothing; and consequently no where.",Chapter XLVI: Of Darkness from Vain Philosophy and Fabulous Traditions,371,Body,Hobbes's materialist definition of the Universe; used to demolish the possibility of non-corporeal separated essences
Entity,"what then would become of these Terms, of Entity, Essence, Essentiall, Essentiality, that are derived from it, and of many more that depend on these, applyed as most commonly they are? They are therefore no Names of Things; but Signes, by which wee make known, that wee conceive the Consequence of one name or Attribute to another.",Chapter XLVI: Of Darkness from Vain Philosophy and Fabulous Traditions,372,Essence,"Hobbes debunks 'Entity' and related scholastic terms as mere signs of logical consequence between names, not names of real things"
Essence,"what then would become of these Terms, of Entity, Essence, Essentiall, Essentiality, that are derived from it, and of many more that depend on these, applyed as most commonly they are? They are therefore no Names of Things; but Signes, by which wee make known, that wee conceive the Consequence of one name or Attribute to another.",Chapter XLVI: Of Darkness from Vain Philosophy and Fabulous Traditions,372,Entity,Hobbes debunking scholastic term; 'Essence' is not the name of a thing but a sign of logical predication; key anti-Aristotelian move
Nunc-stans,"they will teach us, that Eternity is the Standing still of the Present Time, a Nunc-stans (as the Schools call it;) which neither they, nor any else understand, no more than they would a Hic-stans for an Infinite greatnesse of Place.",Chapter XLVI: Of Darkness from Vain Philosophy and Fabulous Traditions,372,,marginal label: Nunc-stans. Hobbes mocks the scholastic notion of eternity as a 'standing now' (Nunc-stans) as meaningless jargon equivalent to a 'standing here' for infinite space
Quantity,"Quantity is nothing else but the Determination of Matter; that is to say of Body, by which we say one Body is greater, or lesser than another, by thus, or thus much.",Chapter XLVI: Of Darkness from Vain Philosophy and Fabulous Traditions,374,Body,"marginal label: Quantity put into already made. Hobbes defines Quantity against the scholastic notion of Condensation/Rarefaction, showing the absurdity of matter without determined quantity"
Ubiquity of Species,"For the Cause of Sense, an ubiquity of Species; that is, of the Shews or Apparitions of objects; which when they be Apparitions to the Eye, is Sight; when to the Eare, Hearing; to the Palate, Tast; to the Nostrill, Smelling; and to the rest of the Body, Feeling.",Chapter XLVI: Of Darkness from Vain Philosophy and Fabulous Traditions,375,Body; Sense; Sense; Sight,"marginal label: Ubiquity of Apparition. Hobbes exposes the Aristotelian-scholastic theory of sensible species as empty words, offering no real causal explanation"
Volitio,"For cause of the Will, to doe any particular action, which is called Volitio, they assign the Faculty, that is to say, the Capacity in generall, that men have, to will sometimes one thing, sometimes another, which is called Voluntas; making the Power the cause of the Act.",Chapter XLVI: Of Darkness from Vain Philosophy and Fabulous Traditions,375,The Will; Voluntas,"marginal label: Will, the Cause of Willing. Hobbes mocks the scholastic account of Volitio as caused by Voluntas — circular reasoning, making the power the cause of the act"
Voluntas,"they assign the Faculty, that is to say, the Capacity in generall, that men have, to will sometimes one thing, sometimes another, which is called Voluntas; making the Power the cause of the Act.",Chapter XLVI: Of Darkness from Vain Philosophy and Fabulous Traditions,375,,"marginal label: Will, the Cause of Willing. Defined (mockingly) as the scholastic term for the general faculty of willing — Hobbes shows it is circular as an explanation of particular acts"
Fortune,"Fortune is the cause of things contingent; that is, of things whereof they know no cause.",Chapter XLVI: Of Darkness from Vain Philosophy and Fabulous Traditions,375,,"marginal label: Ignorance an occult Cause. Hobbes exposes 'Fortune' as a name for ignorance of causes, dressed up in philosophical language — 'occult qualities'"
Occult Qualities,"many Effects to occult qualities; that is, qualities not known to them; and therefore also (as they thinke) to no Man else. And to Sympathy, Antipathy, Antiperistasis, Specificall Qualities, and other like Termes, which signifie neither the Agent that produceth them, nor the Operation by which they are produced.",Chapter XLVI: Of Darkness from Vain Philosophy and Fabulous Traditions,375,,"marginal label: Ignorance an occult Cause. Hobbes debunks occult qualities as terms signifying only ignorance, not real explanatory entities"
Tyrant,"A Tyrant originally signified no more simply, but a Monarch: But when afterwards in most parts of Greece that kind of government was abolished, the name began to signifie, not onely the thing it did before, but with it, the hatred which the Popular States bare towards it.",Chapter XLVI: Of Darkness from Vain Philosophy and Fabulous Traditions,377,,"marginal label: And that all Government but the Popular is Tyranny. Hobbes historicizes 'Tyrant' to show it is a term of abuse, not a descriptive political concept — Aristotelian origin of seditious language"
Private Interpretation of Law,"For a Private man, without the Authority of the Common-wealth, that is to say, without permission from the Representant thereof, to Interpret the Law by his own Spirit, is another Error in the Politiques.",Chapter XLVI: Of Darkness from Vain Philosophy and Fabulous Traditions,378,Authority; Error,marginal label: Private Interpretation of Law. Defined as a political error; Hobbes insists interpretation of law belongs exclusively to the sovereign
Language of Schoole-Divines,"the Writings of Schoole-Divines, are nothing else for the most part, but insignificant Traines of strange and barbarous words, or words otherwise used, then in the common use of the Latine tongue; such as would pose Cicero, and Varro, and all the Grammarians of ancient Rome.",Chapter XLVI: Of Darkness from Vain Philosophy and Fabulous Traditions,379,,"marginal label: Language of Schoole-Divines. Hobbes defines scholastic theological language as meaningless barbarism, failing the test of translatability into modern languages"

Condensed, is when there is in the very same Matter, lesse Quantity than before; and Rarefied, when more.",Chapter XLVI: Of Darkness from Vain Philosophy and Fabulous Traditions,374,Quantity,"marginal label: Quantity put into already made. Hobbes cites and mocks the scholastic definitions of Condensed and Rarefied as self-contradictory, since matter without quantity is impossible"
Pouring in of Souls,"For the cause of the Soule of Man, they say, Creatur Inundendo, and Creando Infunditur: that is, It is Created by Powring it in, and Powred in by Creation.",Chapter XLVI: Of Darkness from Vain Philosophy and Fabulous Traditions,375,,"marginal label: Powring in of Soules. Hobbes quotes and mocks the scholastic formula for the soul's origin as circular tautology — 'created by pouring in, poured in by creation'"

Infallibility,the Pope in his publique capacity cannot erre.,Chapter XLVII: Of the Benefit That Proceedeth from Such Darkness and to Whom It Accrueth,382,,"marginal label: Infallibility. Hobbes identifies papal infallibility as a doctrine designed to secure spiritual sovereignty, not a scriptural truth"
Exemptions of the Clergy,"the exemption of these, and of all other Priests, and of all Monkes, and Fryers, from the Power of the Civill Laws. For by this means, there is a great part of every Common-wealth, that enjoy the benefit of the Laws, and are protected by the Power of the Civill State, which neverthelesse pay no part of the Publique expence; nor are lyable to the penalties, as other Subjects, due to their crimes; and consequently, stand not in fear of any man, but the Pope.",Chapter XLVII: Of the Benefit That Proceedeth from Such Darkness and to Whom It Accrueth,382,Fear,marginal label: Exemptions of the Clergy. Defined as a practical instrument of papal power that removes clergy from civil obligation and accountability

Hobbes exposes 'Sacerdotes' (priests-as-sacrificers) as a usurped Jewish civil title applied to Christian ministers to claim sacrificial power over the Eucharist
Sacrament of Matrimony,"the teaching that Matrimony is a Sacrament, giveth to the Clergy the Judging of the lawfulnesse of Marriages; and thereby, of what Children are Legitimate; and consequently, of the Right of Succession to hereditary Kingdomes.",Chapter XLVII: Of the Benefit That Proceedeth from Such Darkness and to Whom It Accrueth,383,Clergy; Clergy; Right of Succession; Sacrament,marginal label: The Sacramentacion of Marriage. Hobbes identifies the sacramentalization of marriage as a mechanism for clerical control over dynastic succession

Excommunication,"what is it for men to excommunicate their lawful King, but to keep him from all places of Gods publique Service in his own Kingdom? and with force to resist him, when he with force endeavoureth to correct them?

XLV) that Pontifex Maximus was a civil office, confirming the Pope's authority was always derived from the Emperor, not from divine right"

Trained first in the Art of Letters at the Iowa Writers' Workshop, and afterwards in the Science of Government at the University of California, Berkeley, she hath since taken up her station at Harvard, where she governeth by Lecture, Question, and the power of Syllabus. Her principall study is the rise of Systemic Social Theory in the German Idealists; by which is meant that manner of thinking which attributeth to Society as a whole those qualities — as Justice and Oppression — which ordinary men are wont to attribute to particular persons only. She hath won the Melvin Richter Prize for her Dissertation, and is the Sole and Rightful Interpreter of what shall count as participation.",Chapter 1061: The Persons of the Class,1061,Authority; Commonwealth; Justice; Science; Science; University,"marginal label: The Sovereign of the Course; professor of government at Harvard, specialist in early modern political thought and systemic social theory"

This disposition he approacheth through Romanticism and Aesthetick; and, remarkably, through the Philosophy of China. He took his first degree at Yale, which is by the custom of this region a mark of Esteem, though also of some Suspicion.",Chapter 1061: The Persons of the Class,1061,Authority; Desire; History; Nature; Philosophy,"marginal label: The Head Teaching Fellow; PhD candidate at Harvard specialising in Prometheanism, technology, and romanticism"

Chester Mantel,"CHESTER MANTEL is a Student enrolled in this present Course, being a man of such extraordinary Parts that it is a matter of some wonder he hath not yet been appointed to the Faculty. Of quick Understanding, ready Wit, and a Disposition naturally inclined to Justice, he doth attend Lectures with uncommon Diligence, and contributeth to Seminar Discussion with a frequency and Depth remarked upon by all. His is a Genius that Nature hath rarely bestowed upon one so young, uniting as it doth the Acuteness of Hobbes, the Eloquence of Cicero, and the Judgment of Solomon. It is to be expected, by those who have observed him closely, that he will one day governe either a Commonwealth or a considerable part thereof.",Chapter 1061: The Persons of the Class,1061,Commonwealth; Justice; Nature; Understanding; Understanding,marginal label: A Student of Uncommon Gifts; enrolled in Government 1061; future sovereign
Enza Jones,"ENZA JONES is a Student of this present Course, distinguished above all her Fellows by a singular and remarkable Talent: namely, the ability to perform Spoken-Word Autobiographies of Thomas Hobbes.

That she can render such a Life in the first Person, with convincing Affect, is a thing which surpasseth the ordinary Powers of Understanding; for to inhabit the mind of Hobbes requireth not only Learning, but a Courage and an Imagination of the first Order. She is, in short, what Hobbes himself would have called a Soveraign of the Performative Arts.",Chapter 1061: The Persons of the Class,1061,Courage; Exile; Imagination; Imagination; Life; Person; Understanding; Understanding,marginal label: A Student of Singular Performative Gifts; celebrated for spoken-word autobiographies of Hobbes
